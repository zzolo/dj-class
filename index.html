          <h3>Data vs. Visual</h3>

          <p>The MinnData team focuses more on visual work, not necessarily data work.  This means that we want to create visual narratives, and most of the time we use data for this.  But there are plenty of data driven stories that don't have or require visual aspects, and plenty of visual pieces that aren't data driven.</p>

          <h3>Process</h3>

          <p>Our process loosely follows this, but there's lots of ebb and flow.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Idea</strong>.  This can come from many places such as a reporter, an editor, a dataset, or us.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan</strong>.  Analyze data, draw, or prototype with or without code.</li>
            <li><strong>Review</strong>.  Review plan with editors.</li>
            <li><strong>Build</strong>.  Put it all together and make it work on the web.</li>
            <li><strong>Test</strong>.  Make sure it works for everyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Publish</strong>.  Turn the switch.</li>

            <li>Did not start with a question, but just a large data set.</li>
            <li>Initial look and analysis of the data did not reveal any suprising or significant patterns.</li>
            <li>As with most data there is lots of context that is not apparent or quantifiable.  Printer ink versus gasoline spill.</li>

            <li>"The original data supplied to MinnPost by MnDOT that was used to create the maps in this story contained errors. Changes in the standard MnDOT uses to calculate bridge load ratings caused some bridges to have lower structural condition ratings on the maps. We've since updated the maps with new data from MnDOT. The new data produced changed structural ratings for 112 of the 3,844 bridges appearing on the original map."</li>
